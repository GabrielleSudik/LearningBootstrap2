                    This should be 9. Five centuries later Lorem Ipsum experienced a surge in popularity with the release of Letraset's dry-transfer sheets. These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease of use. Letraset included Lorem Ipsum passages in a panoply of fonts, styles, and sizes, solidifying the Latin-esque phrase's place in the print and graphics industry. Those with an eye for detail will have even caught a tribute to the classic text in an episode of Mad Men (S6E1 around 1:18:55 for anyone that didn't).

            you don't have to create separate divs. just put em all in the column, and they will
            work out accordingly.
            be careful that you work within however you define the row, though.-->

                    Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, helped bring Lorem Ipsum into the information age with its 1985 flagship software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with Lorem Ipsum dummy text to help with laying out page content, and other word processors like Microsoft Word followed suit. More recently the growth of web design has helped proliferate Lorem Ipsum across the internet as a placeholder for laying out websites and blogs– and in some cases the final content (don't let that be you!).
